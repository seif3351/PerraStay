PHASE 5: CANCELLATION & CHECKOUT CONFIRMATION - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
=======================================================================

COMPLETION STATUS: âœ… FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING

OVERVIEW:
---------
Phase 5 adds the ability for guests to cancel bookings with tiered refunds based on timing,
and for hosts to confirm checkout with property condition assessment and automatic deposit
refund decisions.

DATABASE CHANGES (shared/schema.ts):
------------------------------------
Extended bookings table with 8 new fields:

Cancellation Fields:
  - cancellationReason: text - Why the booking was cancelled
  - cancelledBy: varchar - User ID who cancelled (guest or host)
  - cancelledAt: timestamp - When the cancellation occurred
  - refundAmount: decimal - Amount refunded to guest

Checkout Confirmation Fields:
  - checkoutNotes: text - Host's notes about the checkout
  - propertyCondition: text - excellent/good/fair/poor/damaged
  - damagesReported: boolean - Whether any damages were found
  - damageDescription: text - Description of damages if reported

Migration: 0002_stiff_harpoon.sql (already pushed to database)

BUSINESS LOGIC (server/storage.ts):
------------------------------------

1. cancelBooking(bookingId, userId, reason):
   - Calculates days until check-in
   - Applies tiered refund policy:
     * 30+ days before: 100% refund
     * 14-29 days before: 50% refund
     * 7-13 days before: 25% refund
     * Less than 7 days: No refund
   - Updates booking status to 'cancelled'
   - Stores cancellation details
   - Returns booking + refundAmount

2. confirmCheckout(bookingId, data):
   - Validates property condition (must be one of 5 valid values)
   - Determines deposit refund eligibility:
     * Auto-refund if: excellent/good condition AND no damages
     * Retain if: fair/poor/damaged condition OR damages reported
   - Updates booking status to 'completed'
   - Stores checkout details
   - Returns updated booking

API ENDPOINTS (server/routes.ts):

       "message": "Booking cancelled successfully. Refund of $150.00 will be processed."
     }

2. POST /api/bookings/:id/checkout
   Authorization: Host only (property.hostId === user.userId)
   Validation:

       "damageDescription": null,
       "checkoutNotes": "Property left in excellent condition"
     }
