================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

RECOMMENDED ORDER:
1. Phase 2 (Access Info) - High Value, Low Complexity
   - Most immediately useful for hosts and guests
   - No complex UI (just forms)
   - No real-time requirements
   
2. Phase 3 (Photos) - High Value, Medium Complexity
   - Important for property protection
   - File upload already handled by server
   - Date-gating logic straightforward
   
3. Phase 4 (Messaging) - Medium Value, High Complexity
   - Nice-to-have but not critical
   - Real-time updates add complexity
   - Consider simpler email-based communication first
   
4. Phase 5 (Cancellation/Checkout) - High Value, High Complexity
   - Critical for business logic
   - Requires careful financial handling
   - Cron job infrastructure needed
   
5. Phase 6 (Maps/Welcome Box) - Low Value, Low Complexity
   - Nice enhancement but not essential
   - Easy to implement (piggyback on Phase 2)
   - Can be done anytime

ALTERNATIVE: MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)
- Implement Phase 2 + Phase 3 first
- Skip messaging (use email notifications instead)
- Implement Phase 5 cancellation only (defer checkout auto-confirm)
- Skip Phase 6 for now

================================================================================
TECHNICAL DEBT AND CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================

PERFORMANCE:
- Consider pagination for bookings list in dashboards
- Add database indexes on bookingId, propertyId in new tables
- Optimize image loading (lazy loading, thumbnails)

SECURITY:
- File upload validation (size limits, file types)
- Rate limiting on messaging endpoint
- Sanitize user inputs in access info and messages

ERROR HANDLING:
- Add error boundaries around booking detail page
- Handle network failures in photo uploads
- Add retry logic for failed uploads

USER EXPERIENCE:
- Loading states for all async operations
- Success/error toast notifications
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Mobile responsiveness testing

TESTING:
- Add unit tests for new API endpoints
- Add integration tests for booking flow
- Test file upload edge cases
- Test authorization boundaries

================================================================================
